User Information: Display author details with dynamically generated profile avatars.

Comments Section: Show comments with commenter names and avatars.

Loading State: Display a spinner during data fetching.

Error Handling: Provide user-friendly error messages when data fails to load.

## Technologies Used

React Native: Framework for building mobile applications.

Expo Router: Navigation and routing within the app.

React Query: Efficient server state management.

React Native Safe Area Context: Ensure safe area handling.

Dynamic Avatars: Utilize UI Avatars API for generating profile pictures.

## Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js

Expo CLI

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
